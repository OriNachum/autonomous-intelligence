# Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 Examples

Welcome to the Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 Examples repository. This project showcases various examples demonstrating the capabilities of the Hailo AI processor on a Raspberry Pi 5. These examples will help you get started with AI on embedded devices.
The examples in this repository are designed to work with the Raspberry Pi AI Kit and AI HAT, supporting both the Hailo8 (26 TOPS) and Hailo8L (13 TOPS) AI processors. The examples can also be run on an x86_64 Ubuntu machine with the Hailo8/8L AI processor.
Visit the [Hailo Official Website](https://hailo.ai/) and [Hailo Community Forum](https://community.hailo.ai/) for more information.

## Hailo Packages Installation

For installation instructions, see the [Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 installation guide](doc/install-raspberry-pi5.md#how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-5-and-hailo).

### Hailo Version Upgrade Instructions

See the [Upgrade or Downgrade Hailo Software](doc/install-raspberry-pi5.md#hailo-version-upgrade-instructions) section for instructions on how to upgrade the Hailo software.

## Available Examples and Resources

### Hailo Python API
The Hailo Python API is now available on the Raspberry Pi 5. This API allows you to run inference on the Hailo-8L AI processor using Python.
For examples, see our [Python code examples](https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/tree/main/runtime/python).
Additional examples can be found in RPi [picamera2](#picamera2) code.
Visit our [HailoRT Python API documentation](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/hailort-v4-18-0/?page=api%2Fpython_api.html#module-hailo_platform.drivers) for more information.

### Hailo Examples

#### [Basic Pipelines (Python)](doc/basic-pipelines.md#hailo-rpi5-basic-pipelines)

These pipelines are included in this repository. They demonstrate object detection, human pose estimation, and instance segmentation in an easy-to-use format.
For installation instructions, see the [Basic Pipelines Installation Guide](doc/basic-pipelines.md#installation).
See our [Developement Guide](doc/basic-pipelines.md#development-guide) for more information on how to use the pipelines to create your own custom pipelines.


##### [Detection Example](doc/basic-pipelines.md#detection-example)
![Detection Example](doc/images/detection.gif)

**Retrained Networks Support**

This application includes support for using retrained detection models. For more information, see [Using Retrained Models](doc/basic-pipelines.md#using-retrained-models).

##### [Detection Service Example](doc/basic-pipelines.md#detection-service-example)
![Detection Service Example](doc/images/detection.gif)


#### CLIP Application

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) predicts the most relevant text prompt on real-time video frames using the Hailo-8L AI processor.
See the [hailo-CLIP Repository](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-CLIP) for more information.

#### Frigate Integration - Coming Soon

Frigate is an open-source video surveillance software that runs on a Raspberry Pi. This integration will allow you to use the Hailo-8L AI processor for object detection in real-time video streams.

### Raspberry Pi Official Examples

#### rpicam-apps

Raspberry Pi [rpicam-apps](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#rpicam-apps) Hailo post-processing examples.
This is Raspberry Pi's official example for AI post-processing using the Hailo AI processor integrated into their CPP camera framework.
The documentation on how to use rpicam-apps can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-kit.html).
The run command is simplified, and the assets are pre-installed in the system.
To run an example from rpicam-apps, run:

```bash
rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov6_inference.json
```

See more available examples in the `/usr/share/rpi-camera-assets` directory.

#### picamera2

Raspberry Pi [picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2) is the libcamera-based replacement for Picamera, which was a Python interface to the Raspberry Pi's legacy camera stack. Picamera2 also presents an easy-to-use Python API.
Run the following command to clone the picamera2 repo and get the example files:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2
```

The examples will be in `./picamera2/examples/hailo/`.
To run an example from picamera2, run:

```bash
cd picamera2/examples/hailo/
python3 pose.py
```
### Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC)

The Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC) is a software tool that enables developers to compile their neural networks to run on the Hailo-8/8L AI processors.
The DFC is available for download from the [Hailo Developer Zone](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/software-downloads/) (Registration required).
For examples, tutorials, and retrain instructions, see the [Hailo Model Zoo Repo](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo).
Additional documentation and [tutorials](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/dataflow-compiler/latest/?sp_referrer=tutorials/tutorials.html) can be found in the [Hailo Developer Zone Documentation](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/documentation/).
For a full end-to-end training and deployment example, see the [Retraining Example](doc/retraining-example.md).
The detection basic pipeline example includes support for retrained models. For more information, see [Using Retrained Models](doc/basic-pipelines.md#using-retrained-models).
