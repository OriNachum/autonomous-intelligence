# Tau - a personal friendly assistant

This is Tau!  
Tau is inspired by Pi.AI and if you havent tried Pi yet, I strongly encourage you to try.
Like Pi, Tau's conversation is on continual conversation, unlike Chat based bots which feature many conversations and threads.  
This is by design - Tau had a single conversation, like speaking to a human. 
.
This is reflected by consulting Tau in decisions made along development: Order of features, voice type, etc.

Tau is a personal fun project.
I open it as an open source for anyone to experiment with (fork), or just follow.
If you fork. delete history and facts to reset its knowledhe and embark rhe journey anew.


## Prerequisites

Tau should be able to run on any linux with internet, but was tested only on a raspberry pi 5 8GB with official OS 64bit.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Copy .env_sample to .env and add all keys:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: used for Claude based text completion and vision. Currently unused.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Used for Speech, Whisper, vision and text.
- GROQ_API_KEY: Used for a super quick action understanding, May be replaced with embeddings.
- VOYAGE_API_KEY: VoyageAI is recommended by Anthropic. They offer the best embeddings to date (of when I selected it), and offer a great option for innovators.
- PINECONE_API_KEY: API Key of pinecone. Serverless is a great option.
- PINECONE_DIMENSION: Dimension of the embeddings generated by Voyage. Used for the setup of Pinecone
- PINECONE_INDEX_NAME: Name of the index in Pinecone, for memory


## Usage

To run the script manually, execute the following command:

```
./checkout-repo.sh
```

This script will change the current directory to the specified `LOCAL_PATH`, pull the latest changes from the specified remote repository, and execute any additional commands you might have added to the script.

### Scheduling the Script

You can also schedule the script to run automatically at a specified interval using cron.

Here's how:

1. Open the cron tab editor:

```
crontab -e
```

2. Add the following line to the cron tab file, replacing the path with the location of your `checkout-repo.sh` script:

```
*/30 * * * * /path/to/checkout-repo.sh
```

This line tells cron to run the `checkout-repo.sh` script every 30 seconds.

3. Save the changes and exit the cron tab editor.

After setting up the cron job, the `checkout-repo.sh` script will run every 30 seconds, checking for updates in the specified repository and pulling the latest changes if there are any.
