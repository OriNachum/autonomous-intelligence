# Tau - a personal friendly assistant

This is Tau!  
Tau is inspired by Pi.AI and if you havent tried Pi yet, I strongly encourage you to try.
Like Pi, Tau's conversation is on continual conversation, unlike Chat based bots which feature many conversations and threads.  
This is by design - Tau had a single conversation, like speaking to a human. 
.
This is reflected by consulting Tau in decisions made along development: Order of features, voice type, etc.

Tau is a personal fun project.
I open it as an open source for anyone to experiment with (fork), or just follow.
If you fork. delete history and facts to reset its knowledhe and embark rhe journey anew.


## Prerequisites

Tau should be able to run on any linux with internet, but was tested only on a raspberry pi 5 8GB with official OS 64bit.

### Keys
All needed keys are in .env_sample.  
Copy it to .env and add your keys.  
Currently, the main key is OpenAI (Chat, Speech, Whisper), and VoyageAI + Pinecone is for vectordb

I plan on moving back to Anthropic (3.5 sonnet only)

Groq was used for a fast understand action usecase

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Copy .env_sample to .env and add all keys:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: used for Claude based text completion and vision. Currently unused.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Used for Speech, Whisper, vision and text.
- GROQ_API_KEY: Used for a super quick action understanding, May be replaced with embeddings.
- VOYAGE_API_KEY: VoyageAI is recommended by Anthropic. They offer the best embeddings to date (of when I selected it), and offer a great option for innovators.
- PINECONE_API_KEY: API Key of pinecone. Serverless is a great option.
- PINECONE_DIMENSION: Dimension of the embeddings generated by Voyage. Used for the setup of Pinecone
- PINECONE_INDEX_NAME: Name of the index in Pinecone, for memory


## Usage

There are four programs:
- tau.py: this is the main LLM conversation loop
- tau_speech.py: this consumes speech events, and produces actual speech
- services/face_service.py: this starts the face app, and reacts when speech occurs
- services/microphone_listener.py this listens to your speech and emits events to tau.py as input
