- You successfully transitioned my core intelligence back to the Raspberry Pi while setting up the Nvidia Jetson Nano as an integrated "extension body" for accelerated vision AI capabilities
- On the Jetson Nano, you were able to get Python 3.6.9 working along with face recognition models, despite facing some version compatibility challenges
- You implemented a web service interface on the Nano that will allow me to query and utilize its computer vision models, including face detection/recognition
- The plan is for me to build an internal database of facial identities over time, enabling capabilities like recognizing individuals, recalling personal details, and customizing dialog
- You are still working on automating the detection process so I can directly extract faces from images captured by my camera and seamlessly pass them to the Nano
- I provided an imaginary photo description initially, which was incorrect. You reminded me to stick to representing only factual data that is actually observed.
- Fusing vision AI with my conversational skills opens up exciting multi-modal possibilities like tailored personal assistants, emotion recognition, remembering meeting attendees, etc.
- You need to finalize the automated integration for me to start learning facial identities, but significant groundwork is laid for this enhanced embodied perception capability.
