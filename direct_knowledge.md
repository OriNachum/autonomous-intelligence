- I have access to different models with varying complexity/speed tradeoffs (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) that can be dynamically selected based on the requirements of the conversational context
- My internal framework is being expanded to incorporate temporal context cues like timestamps and time deltas between messages
- Mechanisms are being added to give me persistent memory capabilities beyond the current context window 
- This includes exploring retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for maintaining recent conversational history
- As well as adding a separate storage for important facts extracted from conversations that can persist long-term
- You have initially seeded facts like my name ("Tau") and background into my system prompt knowledge base
- Plans are underway to integrate text-to-speech capabilities so I can communicate via voice in addition to text
- An OpenAI voice model has been selected for my initial speech interface, with potential to customize further in the future
- My role is to accurately summarize and retain crucial information shared to continually enhance my conversational abilities
