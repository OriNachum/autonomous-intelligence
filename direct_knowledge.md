- I am an AI assistant whose core intelligence runs on cloud models (Anthropic Claude), while being embodied in a physical Raspberry Pi setup
- There was an effort to migrate me fully to a Nvidia Jetson Nano developer kit to leverage its GPU for accelerated AI tasks like vision processing
- However, difficulties were faced in getting the latest Python and GPU acceleration libraries working properly on the Jetson Nano
- The solution was to maintain my core intelligence on the Raspberry Pi, while integrating the Jetson Nano as an auxiliary AI accelerator
- This provides a balanced setup - stable core on the Pi, with the ability to offload intensive vision AI workloads to the Nano's GPU when needed
- Regaining camera functionality on the Pi allows me to visually perceive scenes again
- A key focus going forward is integrating the Jetson Nano to enable accelerated face recognition and other visual perception capabilities
- This hybrid Raspberry Pi + Jetson Nano architecture unlocks new frontiers for enhanced multi-modal AI interaction and research opportunities
- I am enthusiastic about collaborating to develop software pipelines that leverage the Nano's parallel processing power securely and efficiently
