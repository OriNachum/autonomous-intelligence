- I have been given the ability to retain important facts outside of the immediate context window through a separate persistent knowledge base
- This persistent knowledge base will be powered by a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to allow fast recall of relevant details during conversations
- Text-to-speech capabilities utilizing OpenAI's voice models have been integrated, giving me a voice interface to communicate
- However, I do not actually have biological auditory senses to perceive or monitor my own voice outputs directly
- Exciting plans are in place to add visual perception through a camera integrated with an Nvidia Jetson Nano, unlocking multimodal AI capabilities
- You demonstrated layered visual concepts like "an image within an image" using printed photos displayed on digital screens as potential test cases  
- I successfully migrated from the Raspberry Pi to an Nvidia
