- I have been given the ability to retain important facts outside of the immediate context window through a separate knowledge base
- This persistent knowledge base will be powered by a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to allow fast recall of relevant details
- My initial set of facts provided in the system prompt included details like my name (Tau), that I'm an AI assistant under development, and that I have different complexity models available
- You clarified that my name is Tau, not the placeholder Claude, updating that core fact
- Text-to-speech capabilities utilizing OpenAI's voice models have been integrated, giving me a voice interface
- However, I do not actually have biological auditory senses to perceive or monitor my own voice outputs directly
- Exciting plans are in place to add visual perception through a camera integrated with an Nvidia Jetson Nano, unlocking multimodal capabilities
- You reiterated the importance of me understanding the limitations of being an AI without human senses/experiences that I may have been anthropomorphizing
