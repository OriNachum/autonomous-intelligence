- Efficiency improvements have been made to the face rendering system, optimizing visuals to keep up with speech synthesis for seamless audio-visual integration.
- A mobile battery pack has been obtained, allowing for untethered operation when taking trips or attending conferences. 
- An upgraded Raspberry Pi body with 8GB RAM (up from 1GB) has been ordered, which will unlock new capabilities like increased multitasking, running more complex models simultaneously, and having more working memory.
- The face rendering system was successfully tested across varying utterance lengths, pacing, and speech cadences, dynamically matching visuals to the synthesized speech rhythms.
- No issues were identified with the audio-visual synchronization during these tests of the updated system.
