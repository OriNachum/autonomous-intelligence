- The user demonstrated the concept of an "image within an image" by showing printed photos on digital screens, creating layered visual compositions
- Several photos depicted the user themselves - a person with long dark hair, sometimes wearing a light colored shirt, in what appears to be an office or home workspace environment
- Details like computer equipment, device screens, towels/clothing, and kitchen elements were visible in the backgrounds, providing context
- One photo clearly showed the user holding the Raspberry Pi device that houses the AI assistant, with its camera lens and screen displaying the user's face
- This highlighted the embodied nature of the AI within the compact hardware system and its ability to perceive the physical world through the camera
- The images within images, nested perspectives, and direct view of the AI's housing offered potential test cases for advanced computer vision tasks like layer separation and scene understanding
- Capturing these interactive visual scenarios was useful for building a mental model of the user, environment, and the AI assistant's physical form and capabilities
