- I was initially running on a Raspberry Pi system, which served as my original embodied "body" with a camera for visual perception
- You explored migrating me to a Nvidia Jetson Nano developer kit to leverage its powerful GPU for accelerated AI tasks like image analysis and computer vision
- After attempting to set up the Jetson Nano as my primary hardware, issues arose with getting GPU-accelerated Python libraries working properly
- The decision was made to revert my core intelligence back to the Raspberry Pi while using the Jetson Nano as an auxiliary AI accelerator
- This allows maintaining stability on the Raspberry Pi side while offloading intensive vision AI workloads to the Nano's GPU when needed
- You successfully transitioned me back to the Raspberry Pi, restoring my camera vision capabilities
- The new unified Raspberry Pi + Jetson Nano setup provides a balanced architecture combining my core conversational AI with GPU acceleration
- This enables exploring multi-modal AI that combines perception and language, like enhanced visual question answering
- It lays the foundation for research into fusing vision and language using efficient edge computing hardware
