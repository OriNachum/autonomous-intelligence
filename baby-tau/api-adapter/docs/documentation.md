Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the text generation, vision, and audio guides.

Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of unsupported parameters in reasoning models, refer to the reasoning guide.

Request body
messages
array

Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the model you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like text, images, and audio.


Show possible types
model
string

Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

audio
object or null

Optional
Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with modalities: ["audio"]. Learn more.


Show properties
frequency_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

function_call
Deprecated
string or object

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.

Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.


Show possible types
functions
Deprecated
array

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tools.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.


Show properties
logit_bias
map

Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tokens
Deprecated
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control costs for text generated via API.

This value is now deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens, and is not compatible with o-series models.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

modalities
array or null

Optional
Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

["text"]

The gpt-4o-audio-preview model can also be used to generate audio. To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

["text", "audio"]

n
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

prediction
object

Optional
Configuration for a Predicted Output, which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.


Show possible types
presence_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

reasoning_effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

response_format
object

Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using json_schema is preferred for models that support it.


Show possible types
seed
integer or null

Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing service tier. Learn more.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When this parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier utilized.

stop
string / array / null

Optional
Defaults to null
Not supported with latest reasoning models o3 and o4-mini.

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our model distillation or evals products.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information, along with the streaming responses guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.


Show possible types
tools
array

Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.


Show properties
top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

web_search_options
object

Optional
This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more about the web search tool.


Show properties
Returns
Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.
