Trying to set up a docker compose for these:

Template:
PackageName (Path, relative to jetson-containers)
(Dockerfile Content)


speaches (Path, relative to jetson-containers)
(Dockerfile content)

Ollama (./packages/llm/ollama/Dockerfile)
(Dockerfile content)

KokoroTTS fastapi (./packages/speech/kokoro-tts/kokoro-tts-fastapi/Dockerfile)
(Dockerfile content)

Python (./packages/build/python/Dockerfile)
(Dockerfile content)


I will use each of the dockers as a server, and python will host my code in python to use the rest.


Can you set up a docker compose up for me?

I use dusty-nv/jetson-containers for all of these dockers

## Gemini

Okay, let's set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage these services. This configuration assumes:

1.  You have a directory structure where this `docker-compose.yml` file lives at the root, and the `packages` directory is directly inside it (e.g., `./packages/speech/speaches/Dockerfile`).
2.  You are using the NVIDIA container runtime, necessary for GPU access on Jetson platforms (`deploy` section).
3.  You will create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` to manage common build arguments and configurations.
4.  You will create a file named `github_token.secret` containing your GitHub Personal Access Token (required by the Ollama build process to avoid rate limiting). **Do not commit this secret file to Git.**
5.  You have a directory (e.g., `./my_python_app`) containing your Python application code that will use the other services.

---

**1. Create a `.env` file:**

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` and populate it with the necessary build arguments. Adjust the values based on your specific Jetson environment (`dusty-nv/jetson-containers` often defines these).

```dotenv
# .env file

# --- Common Base Image ---
# Specify the base image used by dusty-nv/jetson-containers
# Example: BASE_IMAGE=nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-pytorch:r35.4.1-pth2.1-py3
# Or often derived dynamically in jetson-containers build scripts
# You might need to determine the correct one for your setup or use a placeholder if managed externally.
BASE_IMAGE=jetson-containers:latest # Replace with your actual base image if known

# --- Python Version ---
PYTHON_VERSION_ARG=3.10

# --- Ollama Specific Args (Example values - Adjust!) ---
# Check dusty-nv/jetson-containers for how these are typically determined
CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=72 # Example for Xavier NX/AGX. Check yours (e.g., 53 for Nano, 62 for TX2, 87 for Orin)
CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR=11      # Example, check your JetPack version
JETPACK_VERSION=5.1.2      # Example, check your JetPack version
OLLAMA_REPO=ollama/ollama
OLLAMA_BRANCH=main
GOLANG_VERSION=1.21        # Check required version for Ollama branch
CMAKE_VERSION=3.27         # Check required version

# --- Service Ports (Optional: Override defaults if needed) ---
SPEACHES_PORT=8000
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
KOKORO_PORT=8880
```

**2. Create `github_token.secret` file:**

Create a file named `github_token.secret` in the same directory. Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token into this file on a single line. This token needs read access to public repositories (often no specific scopes are needed, but check if Ollama build fails).

```
YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
```

**3. Create the `docker-compose.yml` file:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

secrets:
  github_token:
    file: ./github_token.secret # Path to your GitHub token secret file

**4. Explanation and Usage:**

1.  **Directory Structure:** Ensure your `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `github_token.secret` files are in the same root directory. Your `packages` directory should be inside this root. Create a directory like `my_python_app` (or whatever you name it) for your application code.
2.  **Fill `.env`:** Edit the `.env` file with the correct `BASE_IMAGE` for your Jetson setup and verify/adjust the other Jetson/CUDA-specific arguments.
3.  **Fill `github_token.secret`:** Put your GitHub token in this file.
4.  **Adjust `python_app` service:**
    * Change the volume mount `./my_python_app:/app` if your code resides elsewhere relative to the compose file.
    * Modify the `command:` line to execute your specific Python script (e.g., `["python", "your_script_name.py"]`). If you want to log in and run commands manually, use `command: ["sleep", "infinity"]` and then use `docker exec -it my_app bash`.
5.  **Ollama GitHub Token:** The current Ollama Dockerfile uses the token directly in a `RUN` command via `ARG`. The compose file passes it as a *secret*. For this to work securely and correctly, you *should ideally modify the Ollama Dockerfile* as shown in the comments within the compose file (using `--mount=type=secret`). If you don't modify the Dockerfile, the build might fail or the secret handling won't be as secure. An alternative (less secure) is to pass `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a build `arg`, but secrets are preferred.
6.  **Run:** Open a terminal in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:
    ```bash
    docker compose build # Build the images (might take a while the first time)
    docker compose up -d # Start the services in detached mode
    ```
7.  **Accessing Services:**
    * Your `python_app` container can access the other services using their service names as hostnames and the specified ports (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`, `http://speaches:8000`, `http://kokoro:8880`). These URLs are passed as environment variables in the example.
    * You can access the exposed ports from your host machine (e.g., `localhost:11434` for Ollama, `localhost:8000` for Speaches, `localhost:8880` for Kokoro).
8.  **Stopping:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down # Stop and remove containers, networks
    ```
9.  **GPU Access:** The `deploy` section is configured for GPU access using the NVIDIA container runtime. Ensure Docker is configured to use it.

This setup provides a robust way to manage your multi-container application on a Jetson device. Remember to adjust paths, commands, and environment variables according to your specific needs.
